    <h1>South Bronx rezoning plan prompts pushback from residents, community activists</h1>
    <h2>BY JANAKI CHADHA</h2>
    <p>A proposal to rezone a large swath of the South Bronx to allow for increased residential development is poised to pass through the City Council later this month. The plan would upzone a 95-block section along Jerome Avenue between 167th and 184th
      streets to allow for taller and denser development. The city says it will increase the availability of affordable housing in the area, but many community advocates say the new housing units won’t actually be affordable for people in the rezoned
      neighborhoods, and worry the proposal could spur displacement.</p>

      <div id="facttwo" class="spot" data-description="The city’s mandatory inclusionary housing policy requires that any new housing development in a rezoned neighborhood set aside between 20 and 30 percent of units to be affordable to families making below Area Median Income (AMI). The median family income in Bronx community districts 4 and 5 is around $25,900, compared to the current AMI, which is $95,400 for a family of four."></div>

    <p>The area is currently zoned for light industrial uses. The zoning change will allow for any new residential buildings to be taller and denser than what’s currently allowed. Per the city’s affordable housing policy, any new housing development in the
      rezoned area would also have to set aside a portion of new units as “affordable,” which according to city calculations, generally means affordable to people making below New York City’s area median income—currently around $95,000 for a family of
      four.</p>

    <p>The proposal has garnered cautious support from the community boards and City Council Members who represent the area. Council members Vanessa Gibson and and Fernando Cabrera have pointed in particular to neighborhood investments that the city has
      promised as part of the plan, which include solutions to overcrowding in local schools and improvements to local subway stations.</p>

    <p>But community activists like Enrique Colon, a leader with local housing advocacy organization CASA, view the plan with skepticism. In particular, he says the city's affordability breakdown would not actually be affordable for many local residents,
      and the many auto-related businesses that populate the area could be displaced. “A lot of things need to happen before this rezoning is passed,” Colon said. “We need deeper affordability, we need stronger protections for auto workers.”</p>

    </div>
    <p>The Jerome Avenue plan would be the fourth neighborhood rezoning passed under the de Blasio administration, as part of the mayor's goal of substantially increasing the city's affordable housing supply over the next few years. The city has previously
      implemented rezonings in East New York, East Harlem and Far Rockaway, all of which faced similar community pushback and affordability concerns.</p>

    <p>The city uses the area median income (AMI) of the entire city to determine affordability, but many advocates argue this policy leaves out low-income residents. Even units that are considered affordable for people making an income of 40 or 60 percent
      of AMI are out of reach for many people who make much less, advocates say. Rachel Meltzer, an Urban Policy professor at The New School said the type of inclusionary zoning policies the city has instituted can only go so far when providing affordable
      housing that’s actually affordable in low-income communities.</p>

    <p>“Inclusionary zoning on its own is not going to get you the deepest subsidies, that's really not what inclusionary zoning is set up to do,” she said. “It's really not going to get to the very low-income households like something like the low-income
      housing tax credit, or Section 8, or even other subsidies that the city is providing, so what inclusionary zoning allows the city to do is use it to get at the more middle-range of affordable units.”</p>
